# Screen Capture

If you capture scene in Unity, you can use [ScreenCapture.cs](https://github.com/yumekaC/dash-streaming/blob/main/source_code/Client/ScreenCapture.cs)

However, if you create ScreenCapture.cs in a Unity scene, you cannot builid the Unity scene for deploy application to HoloLens.

Therefore, you shuold create another Unity scene for using Screen Capure.
