# Screen Capture

If you want to evaluate your compressed point cloud objects with MS-SSIM, you can use [ScreenCapture.cs](https://github.com/yumekaC/dash-streaming/blob/main/source_code/Client/ScreenCapture.cs) in Unity.

However, if you create ScreenCapture.cs in a Unity scene, you cannot builid the Unity scene for deploy application to HoloLens.

Therefore, you shuold create another Unity scene for using Screen Capure.
